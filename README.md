KonohASCII is a free-to-play 2D action Sidescroller Naruto fan-game developed and designed by Mikus DÃ¡niel.
<br><br>
The assets are remade in an ASCII aesthetic, to match the command line look, you see in movies.
<br><br>
The website of the project is available on [Itch.io](https://devmarley.itch.io/konohascii)!

## About the project
The project originates from a [Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/text-rpg-jam). The original idea was a 2D sidescroller demo, where the player controls "Naruto" - the protagonist of the game - and has to fight their way through a horde of enemies.
<br>
I had plenty more ideas to the jam version of the game, but the scope had to be small for me to be able to finish it.<br><br>
This is the fourth installiation and the reconstruct of the original project. Which is intended to be the final.
<br><br>
The story is based on the Naruto manga and anime, but keep in mind that characters and interactions in this game AREN'T CANON!

## Instructions
To setup the project, you'll need just a few things.
<br><br>
I recommend using Unity Hub, because you can easily manage the projects and the editor versions.
<br>
- Download the [Unity Editor version 2020.1.3f1](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2020.1.3) either through the archives or Unity Hub.
- Add the "(underscore)KONOHASCII" folder to the project list, by clicking the "OPEN" button inside the Unity Hub. Or if you don't have the hub Open the project with the correct editor version.
- Open the project.

## Notice
This projects existance is only for entertainment and learning purposes. The creator doesn't have the rights to Naruto. Thus the reason for the project being open source. You may do as you wish with the project.
<br><br>
The game contains violence, blood. It's recommended for age 12 or up.
<br><br>
To be looped in the universe, I recommend atleast watching or reading the first part of Naruto. The game contains spoilers for the Manga and Anime of Naruto part one.
<br>
You can read more about Naruto [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto)!
<br><br>
The origin of the spritesheets are listed at [narutohq.com](http://narutohq.com/sprites.php). Most of them are ripped from the game Naruto: Ninja council 2. I highly appreciate the work of the original creators, and also the "rippers" who made it possible for me to work on the game. 
<br><br>
The users who ripped said spritesheets, which I used for this project:
- [Deekman](Deekman.cjb.net)
- [Bonzai](http://sdb.neuropod.net)
- [Bonai](http://sdb.neuropod.net)
<br>
The mission to credit every person who helped (consciously or otherwise) is ongoing. I promise when the project is finished, I'll do everything to credit everyone. You can help me out, and please tell me if I missed any!
