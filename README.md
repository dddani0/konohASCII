KonohASCII is a free 2D Sidescroller, Naruto fan-game developed and designed by Mikus DÃ¡niel.

The game is available [here](https://devmarley.itch.io/konohascii), on my website.

## About

The project originates from a Text [Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/text-rpg-jam). It also won the 4th place.
After a while it grew out it's small scope and were expanded. However, it's still in progress.

The game's timeline differs from Naruto's timeline. None of the character interactions and actions are canon.
